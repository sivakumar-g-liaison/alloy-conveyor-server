                applications. It integrates Netflix-karyon and AngularJS with projects like Angular-UI, Angular-Strap,
                Bootstrap, and
                jQuery, along with examples of angular services, directives, controllers, and filters. And adds
                aditional support for auditing, dynamic web services, and more.
